tcpping-smokeping
================================================================================

A minimal replacement for tcpping intended to be used with SmokePing. The
implementation uses the TCP support in recent versions of traceroute instead of
tcptraceroute. One of the reasons for using traceroute rather than
tcptraceroute is that the latter will only output "Got root?" when trying to
use it as a normal user, even if the binary is marked with the cap_net_raw
capability.

To use tcpping-smokeping, just point SmokePing at the tcpping-smokeping script
by setting the binary key in the TCPPing subsection in the Probes section:

    + TCPPing
    binary = /etc/smokeping/tcpping-smokeping


The script expects to be invoked as follows:

    /path/to/tcpping-smokeping -C -x PINGS TARGET [PORT]

where PINGS is the number of pings SmokePing is configured to send to the
TARGET, and the optional parameter PORT is the port to probe.


tcpping-smokeping requires the traceroute binary to either have the cap_net_raw
capability (preferred), or to be marked SUID.

You can apply the cap_net_raw capability by running e.g:

    setcap cap_net_raw+ep /usr/bin/traceroute

and verify with:

    getcap /usr/bin/traceroute


If the script is not working correctly with SmokePing, you can debug it by
adding -x to the sh parameters in the first line of the script and manually
invoke it as the user SmokePing is running under.
